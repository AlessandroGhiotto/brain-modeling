# Izhikevich Neuron Model Analysis

Brain Modeling project

Link to the Web Application is [here](https://brain-modeling-project.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Izhikevich neuron model, exploring various neuronal behaviors and network structures. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with simulations and visualizations, and a Streamlit web application that allows users to interactively modify model parameters and observe their effects.

## Contents

- **Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing and analyzing the Izhikevich model. The notebook covers:

  - Different neuronal behaviors (e.g., regular spiking, intrinsically bursting, chattering, fast spiking, thalamocortical neurons, resonator, and low-threshold spiking).
  - Phase plane plots for visualizing neuron dynamics.
  - A simulation of a population of neurons in a sparse network of spiking cortical neurons.
  - A small-world network implementation.
  - Raster plots, firing rate analysis, and power spectral density plots.

- **Streamlit App**: A web application (implemented with Streamlit) that provides an interactive environment to experiment with the Izhikevich model. Users can adjust model parameters and observe how neuronal activity changes in real time.

## Credits

- **Izhikevich Model**: Developed by Eugene M. Izhikevich.
- **Web Application**: Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to provide an interactive experience.
